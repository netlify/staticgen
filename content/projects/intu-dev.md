# INTUITION.DEV

#### 'INTUITION.DEV is an open source tool for pro developers w/ 10 fold productivity; via low-code application development, cross-platform static-generator, and a built-in WebAdmin editor - facilitating maintenance by end users.'

#### Please star our main project here:
- https://github.com/intuition-dev/INTUITION

INTUITION.DEV has WebAdmin Screen for any CRUD app, CMS, e-Com, Mobile, AMP, etc.  It uses [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and is written in [pug](https://pugjs.org/language/tags.html).

In WebAdmin, you can edit screen app or content using markdown or pug - which won't let you pages become broken. It also can leverage native custom elements/ standard web-components and use any framework. It allows you clone existing pages to write another post/page, upload images, custom write own layout in pug, etc. Anything app that you can write or use in HTML, .js/.ts or css/SASS can leverage INTUITION.DEV.


# INTUITION.DEV development productivity features:

- Any css framework, or default to BootStrap
- Any .js framework, or our own default: ViewModel
- Iterative development: reduce maintenance and iteration cost via our WebAdmin editor.
- Most of the maintenance can be done by end users
- High productivity Low-Code: like MS PowerApps, Oracle Visual Builder, Coda.io, Wix Corvid; but for professional developers.
- Can leverage native custom elements/ standard web-components 
- Static Generator: You write Sass, Pug, .ts: it emits SEO friendly static content(including optional AMP) to the CDN.
- Cross Platform from single code base: Web, IOS, Android (similar to Google's Fultuer, but instead leveraging Adobe's free https://Build.PhoneGap.com); but with working SEO. 
- Built-in support for I18N 
- A path of adjusting/migrating other apps to use INTUITION.DEV tool. 
- 100% of our code is Open Source! What you build with the tools is your license.

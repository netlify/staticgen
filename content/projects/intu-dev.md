# INTUITION.DEV

#### 'INTUITION.DEV is the futuristic open source tool for pro developers w/ 10 fold productivity; via automation, low-code, cross-platform, static-generator, and a built-in WebAdmin editor - facilitating app maintenance by end-users.'

#### Please star our main project here:

## INTUITION.DEV approach:

In a future with increasing automation, citizen-developers have become more widespread. Nowadays almost everybody can pull out a form or a web app using low-code tools.
Unlike other low-code tools, this one is aimed at professional developers and uses a standard language: Pug. We started first with a static code generator and then added a WebAdmin that lets you edit - and then kept adding features and refactoring. We hope to make open source low code approach popular with professional developers.

# INTUITION.DEV pro development features:

1. Standards Based / Pug
1. Open Source
1. SEO
2. Custom Elements
2. CRUD | ViewModel
2. built in user auth
2. FTS and SQL
2. keyboard driven (F12 Custom Elements In V1.1)
2. cross platform / mobile from single code base


### Easy

So we have open source low-code with static generation.
A major piece is adding a 'WebAdmin' editor to INTUITION.DEV and your application. One a professional developer writes and sets up version one of the app - then the developer can
 enable end-user to maintain the app and possibly write the next version of the app. So as the business needs change, the web app is evergreen and always aligned to the business. 

You can write any and every kind of app, since we generate  HTML, javascript an css.  Our main language is Pug, if you have not seen Pug before, here is a quick intro to Pug:

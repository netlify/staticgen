description: A simple Markdown static site generator.
---

Poole is an easy to use Markdown driven static website generator. You write the content of your pages in Markdown and Poole creates a nice and simple site with a navigation menu. You don't need to learn a template or preprocessing engine.

### Philosophy

Poole is made for simple sites. Its simplicity means it has minimal technical requirements and doesn't require the user to learn any templating system.

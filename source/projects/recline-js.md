description: Library for building data applications in pure JavaScript and HTML.
---

A simple but powerful library for building data applications in pure Javascript and HTML.

Recline re-uses best-of-breed presentation libraries like SlickGrid, Leaflet, Flot and D3 to create data 'Views' and allows you to connect them with your data in seconds.

The Recline Library consists of 3 parts: Models, Backends and Views:
* Models help you structure your work with data by providing some standard objects such as Dataset and Record – a Dataset being a collection of Records
* Backends connect your Models to data sources (and stores) – for example Google Docs spreadsheets, local CSV files, the DataHub, ElasticSearch etc.
* Views are user interface components for displaying, editing or interacting with the data. For example, maps, graphs, data grids or a query editor.
